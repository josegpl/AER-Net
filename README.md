#Motivation

Melanoma is one of the most severe skin cancer types due to its high mortality rate, which can achieve 70%. An early diagnosis of the disease is crucial as it increases the ten-year survival rate up to 97%. The segmentation of skin lesions is one of the essential steps of the diagnosis process for accurate melanoma detection. However, even for specialist doctors, segmenting these lesions is costly and challenging due to the wide variety of stains, which can have irregular edges, different dimensions, and colors, and due to the high amounts of exams to analyze. Automatic detection of the lesion area for segmentation proves to be an important area of study so that the specialist doctor can focus on the correct diagnosis of the disease itself. 

This work aims to propose a new model based on encoder-decoder architectures that achieve efficiency and performance parameters for the segmentation of dermoscopic images.
